Regular expressions, also known as regex, are a sequence of characters that define a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, a regex can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. This tutorial was created to provide an example on how to read regular expressions and how each component works.
